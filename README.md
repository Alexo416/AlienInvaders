# AlienInvaders Game Using Python ðŸ‘½

While in my first semester at the same time I was studying Python I was using a Python book to further improve my skills, part of this book was to create an Alien Invaders game which was very fun to build, it was a great experience seeing this run for the first time during my first semester.
